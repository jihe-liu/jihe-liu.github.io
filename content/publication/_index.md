Throughout my career, I am lucky work with brilliant minds in different disciplines, including computer scientist, cancer biologist, developmental biologist, medicinal chemist. Below are some selected publications. For the full list of publication, please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n5f2Z60AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
